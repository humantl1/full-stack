Weekly Summaries

Week 1
- Study basic html
  - DOM : HTML is encoded as a tree structure with each element as a node
    - An HTML doc is parsed and translated as a DOM by the browser
  - Doctypes : informs browser of type of document contained
  - Elements : objects in html doc tree
  - Attributes : keywords used to control element behavior
  - Block vs Inline : Block elements essentially have a newline char encoded
  - Headers : Block element of header text
  - Line Breaks : breaks inline element to new line
  - Strong & Emphasis : visual and auditory elements
  - Underline : purely visual element
  - Links (external, internal, relative)
    - External : link to external webpage
    - Internal : link to location in current doc
    - Relative : link to page filepath relative to current doc
  - Images : can reference file or link. 
    - Alternate display text, title, width and height are attributes
  - Div : the most common element. Block element and can have most other elements embedded inside
  - List (ordered & unordered) : automated numbered or bulletted lists
  - Tables : Once used for site formatting, now most commonly used for emails and pdfs. Non-responsive
  - Responsiveness : The ability of a website to dynamically format based on viewport display

- Code example snips of html for practice
- Make a master html doc of all html learned to date
  - Include relavent theory using comments

Week 2
- Study basic web concepts
  - Web requests : aka "handshakes", the exchange of information between users and servers
    - the size is variable depending on the information being exchanged
  - Request types : 
    - GET : the "standard" request. Receives information
    - POST : saving information
    - DELETE : deleting info
    - PUT/PATCH : update info
  - Domain Name Mapping : websites point to IP addresses, which communicate with servers
  - Request Lifecycle : when a request to access a site is sent, the server may accept the request and 
    output the relevent data as a response 
    - Then the browser downloads the data and saves them on the local computer (cache),
      piecing it together to render the content
  - Server response : can be any format, but is typically HTML/CSS/JavaScript or plain text or json
    - For APIs, requests are generally smallish and similar to plain text
    - Browsers download responses and the browser engine handles parsing and extracting the relevant data
- Study intermediate HTML
  - Favicons : tab icons
  - Pathing file structure
  - Inline CSS
  - HTML Classes : similar to C family classes. Seems to essentially consist of a number of fields. Maybe more like a struct
  - HTML IDs : unique identifier
  - Code Formatting
  - HTML Entities : instead of escape charaters, html uses this "entity" concept
  - Forms (buttons, fields, etc)
  - Embedded video
- Code a simple website with HTML and a little CSS

Week 3
- Study CSS concepts
  - CSS : Cascading Style Sheets
    - Can be "applied" 3 ways:
      - Inline : with style HTML attribute
      - Internal : with <style> element
      - External : with .css files
  - Class : containers that store one or more CSS rules that can be applied to one or more HTML elements
  - ID : unique container that stores rules similar to class attribute. Has advanced applications in regards to JavaScript
  - Syntax :
    - Selector : denote which element(s) CSS rule(s) will be applied to
      - These selectors can be grouped to appy to multiple element types or nested to apply to specific nested element schemes
    - Declaration : this is the rule that will be applied to selected elements
      - Property : the type of rule to be applied, e.g. font-size
      - Value : the value of the property to be applied, e.g. the specific font point size to be applied
  - Some specific CSS rules that stand out:
    - Link states : rules that apply to specific states links can have, e.g. hovered over or previously visited
    - Measurement systems : just as there are multiple measurement systems for physical objects, CSS has multiple systems as well
      - px : absolute pixels size
      - em : relative to size of direct or nearest parent element
      - rem : relative to size of root element
    - Display Types : This seemed maybe the most important basic rule. Changes the the behavior of an element in regards to default
        element width and which rules can be applied to an element. Gives the div element great flexibility.
    - There are many text-specific rules; effectively CSS allows complete control over text display
    - Padding/Margin : CSS uses a space format that has a border-area around an element and then a padding buffer between the element
        and border and a margin buffer outside of the border. These can be modified or eleminated.
- Code CSS
  - Constructed a html/css document that contains both examples and documentation of concepts learned this week
  - Constructed a website homepage using CSS following a requested design specification.
